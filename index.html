    <h2>About Me</h2>
    </section>
       <p><strong>WENDY MEDINA</strong><i>(she/they)</i> is a writer and editor based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently she is pursuing her master’s in journalism at UC Berkeley's Grauate School of Journalism after serving as a freelance staff writer at Black Enterprise Magazine and as copy editor for Latino media company mitú.</p>
      <p>Wendy has the range of both a writer and editor, which she utilizes to create not only captivating stories, but deliver virtually flawless content that hit target dates and audience reach with poise. Her previous work experience has entailed a copy editor role at Black Enterprise as well as the Black News Channel, a since dissolved television news channel. Prior to BNC, she was a staff writer, Spanish translator, and copy editor at the Pioneer Newspaper, California State University East Bay’s print newspaper.</p>
      <p>A versatile writer and editor with over five years experience crafting compelling stories for publication, Wendy welcomes the frenzied buzz of a newsroom. As a multifaceted professional with great attention to detail, she is able to research and oversee layout and content simultaneously. Wendy’s contributions have been responsible for organic growth at Black Enterprise, Black News Channel, and The Pioneer.</p>

        “If your dream doesn't scare you, it isn't big enough.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In 2016, Wendy earned a bachelor's degree in English with a focus in creative writing from Cal State East Bay. There, she also was part of the editing team responsible for reviving and publishing the school's literary journal, Occam's Razor Literary Magazine. With over 350 published articles and a handful of short stories out in print, her voice and passion for topics she heads on transcend the page.</p>

      <p>Apart from her solid work ethic and intellect, Wendy’s vast interests outside of journalism give a face to her creativeness, fueled in part by the hardships she has conquered. She finds joy in activism, social justice, arts and culture, videography, culinary arts, mixology, and horticulture, among others. She is a creative in all sense of the word, who found healing in her pen after having to face her formative years in homeless encampments and battle for survival throughout her youth. Having marched for women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, Black Lives Matter, and immigration rights, activism and reform sit at the heart of her journalistic pursuits. Wendy accepts the responsibility of searching for the truth and setting it free to the world, keen on stories not normally reported in mainstream media. She brings back the things she has experienced to breathe life into her work in a stimulating way.</p>
      <p>Wendy was born in Orange County in Southern California and raised primarily in South Central Los Angeles and Lynwood. She moved to the San Francisco Bay Area for college, where she would go on to live after falling in love with the rich culture of the Bay. Currently, Wendy resides in Oakland. Having already delved into her journalistic career, she aspires to further her education so she may perfect her craft and perhaps break into the coding world. She embraces the next chapter of her story with open arms, as she lives by the mantra: “If your dream doesn't scare you, it isn't big enough.”</p>
